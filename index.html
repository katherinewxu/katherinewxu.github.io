Hi there! Iâ€™m Katherine, a student at Stanford University pursuing a B.S. in [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/) with a concentration in AI where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Jerry Cain. I'm passionate about finding new ways to use AI to benefit humanity. At Stanford, I'm a student researcher at Stanford Vision and Learning Lab (SVL), where I am fortunate to work with Professors Fei-Fei Li and Ehsan Adeli at the [Partnership in AI-Assisted Care](https://med.stanford.edu/pacresearch.html). In my free time, I enjoy exploring the outdoors, sampling the local food scene, curating increasingly niche Spotify playlists, and listening to music.

Feel free to reach me at kwx04 [at] stanford [dot] edu!
