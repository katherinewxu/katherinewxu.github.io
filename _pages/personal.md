### The Outdoors
I grew up in Ohio and have always loved being outdoors — whether it’s hiking, backpacking, or just soaking in the quiet. At Stanford, I’m a trip leader at the Outdoor Center, where I lead backpacking and camping trips to help others explore and reconnect with nature.

### Art & Fashion
I also have a passion for art and fashion designing, where I enjoy expressing my creativity through unique designs and bold style choices. This past winter I designed a piece as part of the [Stanford FashionX Show](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/02/fashionx-brings-the-runway-to-a-sold-out-show-at-memorial-church)!
