### The Outdoors
I grew up in Ohio and have always loved being outdoors ðŸŒ² â€” whether itâ€™s hiking ðŸ¥¾, backpacking ðŸŽ’, or just soaking in the quiet ðŸŒ„. At Stanford, Iâ€™m a trip leader at the Outdoor Center, where I lead backpacking and camping trips to help others explore and reconnect with nature ðŸŒ¿.

I also have a passion for art and fashion designing ðŸ‘—ðŸŽ¨, where I enjoy expressing my creativity through unique designs and bold style choices.
