Hi there! 👋 I’m Katherine, a student at Stanford University pursuing a B.S. in [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/) with a concentration in AI 🤖 as well as concurrently pursuing a M.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in AI, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Jerry Cain. 

I'm passionate about finding new ways to use AI to benefit humanity 🌍. At Stanford, I'm a student researcher at Stanford Vision and Learning Lab (SVL), where I am lucky to work with Professors Fei-Fei Li and Ehsan Adeli at the [Partnership in AI-Assisted Care](https://med.stanford.edu/pacresearch.html). In my free time, I enjoy exploring the outdoors 🌲, sampling the local food scene 🍽️, curating increasingly niche Spotify playlists 🎵, and reading 📚.

Feel free to reach me at kwx04 [at] stanford [dot] edu! ✉️
