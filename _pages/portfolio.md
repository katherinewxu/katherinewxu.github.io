<p>
  Inspired by my interdisciplinary coursework, I am drawn to research leveraging AI for positive change in the world. I aim to better understand human cognitive processes and technologies to create AI systems that can support education, healthcare, and assistive technologies in meaningful, human-centered ways.

  <span style="color:#52ADC8"><b>Robust Brand Logo Detection Under Adversarial Conditions</b></span> [<a href="/files/CS131_Final_project (3).pdf" target="_blank">paper</a>]<br>
  <sub>
    <i>Final report for Stanford's CS 131: Computer Vision: Foundations and Applications (Winter 2025)</i><br>
    Developed a custom CNN and adversarial training pipeline to detect Coca-Cola logos in real-world waste images under noise, blur, and occlusion, comparing performance against YOLOv8 and achieving a +13% accuracy improvement with synthetic distortions and data augmentations.

  <span style="color:#52ADC8"><b>Heap Allocator</b></span> [code available upon request]<br>
  <sub>
    <i>Final project for Stanford's CS 107: Computer Systems and Organization (Winter 2025)</i><br>
    Built an implicit and explicit heap allocator from scratch in C, implementing malloc, free, and realloc with performance and memory utilization tradeoffs. Developed a custom validation suite, debugging tools, and internal consistency checks (validate_heap, dump_heap) to test correctness under real-world allocation traces.

  <span style="color:#52ADC8"><b>What’s in the noise? Advancing Musical Genre Classification using Neural Networks</b></span> [<a href="/files/CS 129 Final Writeup (2).pdf" target="_blank">paper</a>] [<a href="https://github.com/katherinewxu/129Final" target="_blank">code</a>]<br>
  <sub>
    <i>Final report and poster for Stanford's CS 129: Applied Machine Learning (Winter 2024)</i><br>
    Trained and evaluated VGG-based neural networks on mel spectrograms from the GTZAN dataset to classify music genres, experimenting with LSTM, GRU, and CNN architectures, and boosting performance with audio data augmentation (noise, pitch-shift, time-stretch).

  <span style="color:#52ADC8"><b>Protecting Against Propaganda: Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for Enhanced Misinformation Identification and Critical Thinking</b></span> [<a href="/files/CS197___Final_Draft (2).pdf" target="_blank">paper</a>]<br>
  <sub>
    <i>Final report and poster for Stanford's CS 197: Computer Science Research (Winter 2024)</i><br>
    Designed a browser extension powered by GPT-4 to detect persuasive fallacies in political news articles, providing users with real-time annotations and an “extremeness” score to enhance critical thinking. Conducted a pilot user study with randomized control groups to evaluate impact on media trust, intellectual humility, and misinformation resilience.
